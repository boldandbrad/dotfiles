# üè† boldandbrad's humble dotfiles

> Welcome `$HOME`!

This repo makes moving into a new system a breeze by automatically furnishing it
with your favorite apps, and giving you the tools you need to maintain it. I
have made my preferences open source to serve as an example for others. If you
wish to use them as a blueprint for your own, please fork this repo and
[personalize](#personalize) the contained files before unpacking.

## üì¶ Unpack <a id="unpack"></a>

> **Warning**: Before unpacking, consider reviewing the repo [contents](#contents) to
> make sure they match your style. Any existing configs may be overwritten.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boldandbrad/dotfiles/main/ship.sh)"
```

This will download and run [`ship.sh`](../ship.sh), which
clones this repo to `~/Setup/dotfiles` (if not present), and then prompts you to
run [`unpack.sh`](../unpack.sh).

Alternatively you can clone the repo yourself and run [`unpack.sh`](../unpack.sh)
manually.

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/boldandbrad/dotfiles.git ~/Setup/dotfiles
cd ~/Setup/dotfiles && ./unpack.sh
```

The unpack script explains what it will do, prompts before doing so, and is
idempotent. This means it can be safely run multiple times without compounding
changes or breaking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintain <a id="maintain"></a>

To make system maintanence simpler post-install, a handful of convenient
commands are provided. Invoke these from anywhere.

| `sys-refresh` | Rerun system setup ([`unpack.sh`](../unpack.sh))          |
| `sys-clean`   | Clean system caches and app data (‚ùå Coming soon)           |
| `dot-commit`  | Persist current dotfiles to github (‚ùå Coming soon)         |
| `dot-relink`  | Relink installed dotfiles                                   |
| `zsh-reload`  | Reload shell environment ([`.zshrc`](../config/zsh/.zshrc)) |

## üõãÔ∏è Contents <a id="contents"></a>

```

### Configs

Most packages and apps respect the
[XDG base directory specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/index.html)
to determine where to store configurations and data. This creates consistency
and predictability while keeping `~/` free of clutter.

The following XDG variables are defined in [`.zshenv`](../config/zsh/.zshenv), which is sourced before symlinking.

| Env Variable      | Location              |
| -                 | -                     |
| `XDG_BIN_HOME`    | `~/.local/bin`        |
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME`  | `~/.local/var/cache`  |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `~/.config`           |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME`   | `~/.local/share`      |
| `XDG_LIB_HOME`    | `~/.local/lib`        |
| `XDG_STATE_HOME`  | `~/.local/state`      |
