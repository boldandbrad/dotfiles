# dotfiles

> `$HOME`, sweet `$HOME`

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repo! I have made it open source to serve as an
example for others. If you wish to use it, please fork and make your own
[customizations](#customization) to the contained files before install.

## 📢 About <a id="about"></a>

### Repository Structure

│  └── ..

├── remote_install.sh   # Remote installation script.
└── symlinks.yaml       # Dotbot symlink configuration.
```

### XDG Directories

Most packages and apps respect the
[XDG base directory specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/index.html)
to determine where to store configurations and data. This creates consistency
and predictability while keeping `~/` free of clutter.

The following XDG variables are defined in [`.zshenv`](../config/zsh/.zshenv).

| Env Variable      | Location              |
| -                 | -                     |
| `XDG_BIN_HOME`    | `~/.local/bin`        |
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME`  | `~/.local/var/cache`  |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `~/.config`           |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME`   | `~/.local/share`      |
| `XDG_LIB_HOME`    | `~/.local/lib`        |
| `XDG_STATE_HOME`  | `~/.local/state`      |

## ⚙️ Customization <a id="customization"></a>

> Coming soon.

## 📦 Installation <a id="installation"></a>

> **Warning**: Before continuing, consider reviewing the repo contents to
> validate it is what you want.

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boldandbrad/dotfiles/main/remote_install.sh)"
```

This will download and run [`remote_install.sh`](../remote_install.sh), which
clones this repo to `~/Setup/dotfiles` (if not present), and then prompts you to
run [`install.sh`](../install.sh).

Alternatively you can clone the repo yourself and run the install script
manually ([`install.sh`](../install.sh)).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/boldandbrad/dotfiles.git ~/Setup/dotfiles
cd ~/Setup/dotfiles && ./install.sh
```

The install script does several things. It explains what it will do, prompts
before doing so, and is idempotent. This means it can be safely run multiple
times without compounding changes or breaking.

## 🚀 Usage <a id="usage"></a>

commands are provided. Invoke these from anywhere.

| `sys-refresh` | Rerun system setup ([`install.sh`](../install.sh))          |
| `sys-clean`   | Clean system caches and app data (❌ Coming soon)           |
| `dot-commit`  | Persist current dotfiles to github (❌ Coming soon)         |
| `dot-relink`  | Relink installed dotfiles                                   |
