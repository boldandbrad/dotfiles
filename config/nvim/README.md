# Neovim Configuration

This directory contains my personal Neovim config. It is a fairly minimal setup
optimized for coding in languages like Go and Rust, and note-taking in Markdown.

## Requirements

- Neovim v0.11+
- Language Servers
  - deno
  - gopls
  - lua-language-server
  - marksman
  - ruff
  - rust-analyzer
  - taplo
